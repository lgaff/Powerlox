# PowerLox

Powerlox is a reimplementation of the Lox programmming language, described in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), by Robert Nystrom. The implementation language of choice is Powershell. It follows closely the *jlox* implementation described in the first half of the book.

Powerlox is not intended to be a word-for-word copy of *jlox*, rather the goal is to *translate* wherever possible the semantics of the Java implementation into their idiomatic Powershell equivalents. As I started this effort while still relatively new to Powershell's often incomprehensible and sometimes downright broken class implementation, I have not always been completely successful in doing so.
